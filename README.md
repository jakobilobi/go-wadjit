# wadjit

Wadjit (pronounced /ˈwɒdʒɪt/, or "watch it") is a program for endpoint monitoring and analysis.

> Wadjet is the ancient Egyptian goddess of protection and royal authority. She is sometimes shown as the Eye of Ra, acting as a protector of the country and the king, and her vigilant eye would watch over the land. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadjet)

Wadjit spawns a number of Watchers that monitor endpoints and report their status back to the central loop. From the central loop, the responses from the endpoints can be analyzed and acted upon.
